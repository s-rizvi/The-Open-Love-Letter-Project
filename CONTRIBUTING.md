# 🤝 Contributing to *The Open Love Letter Project*

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is both a personal offering and a growing public archive — rooted in devotional writing, scientific metaphor, and sacred beauty.

While the main manuscript is authored and curated by me (*Noor Rizvi*), thoughtful contributions are welcomed through structured channels to preserve the spiritual, poetic, and intellectual integrity of the project. My aim is to open a conversation on anything that can be related to citeable theological literature (Islamic or otherwise), but with one condition: it must speak to your soul in some way.

## 🧠 How You Can Contribute

- **📂 File an Issue**  
  Spot a typo, formatting bug, or have a scientific or poetic suggestion? Open an [Issue](../../issues) or contact me on Instagram [@openloveletterproject](https://www.instagram.com/openloveletterproject) to begin a conversation.

- **🔀 Fork the Repository**  
  Forks and derivative works are allowed (and encouraged) under the terms of the license (see below). You may explore your own versions of the manuscript or research. By allowing forks I wish to see others emulate this style of poetry using their own ideas, ideally writing an entirely new manuscript with your own authorship under this project. Warning: repository/project owners retain the right to delete forks.

- **📬 Submit a Pull Request**  
  Only approved contributors may submit pull requests to the `main` branch. All PRs are subject to review. Please limit PRs to the following:
  - Formatting fixes or code improvements in `.ipynb`
  - Citation or clarity suggestions in scientific interludes
  - Accessibility or UI enhancements in manuscript rendering
